# camera-calibration
Camera calibration is a common problem in Computer vision. We implemented a camera calibration with a checker calibration object by use of corner detection, correspondence matching and a MATLAB toolbox for comparison.

### Procedure
1. I used a two checkerboards that is post on the wall as a calibration object. 
2. I used Harris corner detection method to detect the corners in the image. 
3. After that, I need to to match some correspondence points in real worlds by creating a coordinate system and in camera pixels.
4. This was a hard task because we entered each cornersâ€™ pixels and real world coordinates manually.
5. We used 91 corners and created the a correspondence matrix (x pixel, ypixel, xrealworld, yrealworld, zrealworld).
6. After that I constructed our P matrix (see the PDF file for details)
7. Lastly I used SVD to get the m matrix that will be used to find the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

### Camera Calibration Toolbox for MATLAB 

In this section of the lab, we will use a MATLAB toolbox to calibrate our camera. I took 20 photos of a checkerboard from different angles and load them into the toolbox. Then, we manually plotted the coordinate plane and toolbox automatically detected the corners in the each image. Actually, we applied this steps on all of 20 images. (details are explained in my report)
